# IEEE-CS IoT Board

The IEEE-CS IoT Board is an ESP32-C3 based development board for the IEEE-CS USF student organization, to be used in firmware, hardware, and IoT design events. 
The current version features an integrated MCP9808 temperature sensor and broken out GPIO pins. The hole in the corner of the board serves as a keychain attachment, and you can get one
